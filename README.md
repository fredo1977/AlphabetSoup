Machine Learning with Neural Networks


#How many neurons and layers did you select for your neural network model? Why?
##-There are 8 nuerons because of the 8 catagorical groups in the data frame. There are only 2 hidden layers as we were able to determine that additional layers would not scew the results. 

#Were you able to achieve the target model performance? What steps did you take to try and increase model performance?
##-No, the model produced a 53% accuracy. Additional steps would have been altering the nuerons against the hidden layers. Additionally to have choosing different catagorys. 


#If you were to implement a different model to solve this classification problem, which would you choose? Why?
##Another option would be Random Forest. Random forest classifier is a meta-estimator that fits a number of decision trees on various sub-samples of datasets and uses average to improve the predictive accuracy of the model and controls over-fitting. The sub-sample size is always the same as the original input sample size but the samples are drawn with replacement.
